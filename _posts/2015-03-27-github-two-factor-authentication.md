Two-factor authentication in GitHub is pretty simple to set up, though the exact steps are layed out in maybe 3 different articles. I've consolidated them all together to this one simple guide.

### Enable 2FA
Enable [2 factor authentication](https://github.com/settings/security) on the GitHub website (Settings → Security → Two Factor Authentication).

### Prepare your phone
Install [Google Authenticator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Authenticator). Works for iOS and Android. In Authenticator, tap *Add*, then *Scan Barcode*. Take a picture of the QR code on your computer. ([More info on apps](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-two-factor-authentication-via-a-totp-mobile-app/))

### Enable git credential caching
On your computer, [enable caching your GitHub HTTPS credentials](https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git/). This allows you to store your 2FA token and not get asked for it everytime.

```
git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain   # OSX
git config --global credential.helper cache         # Linux
```

### Generate an API key

[Generate a GitHub API key](https://github.com/settings/tokens) under "Personal Access Tokens". You'll use this for the Git command line. Leave the scopes unchanged.

### Use HTTPS on your repos
If your git repos still use SSH (`git@github.com:user/repo.git`), change them to use HTTPS (`https://github.com/user/repo.git`). ([More info on remote URLs](https://help.github.com/articles/which-remote-url-should-i-use/#cloning-with-https-recommended))

```
cd project
vim .git/config
```

### Git push
Push a repo. You'll be asked for a password. Use the token for the password. You won't have to do this again if enabled credential caching.

```
$ git push
Username for 'https://github.com': rstacruz
Password for 'https://rstacruz@github.com':
```

### Save your recovery codes

Get your [recovery codes](https://github.com/settings/auth/recovery-codes) (Settings → Security → Two Factor Authentication → Recovery Codes) and put them somewhere safe. This will allow you to log onto your account when, say, your phone isn't charged. ([More info on recovery codes](https://help.github.com/articles/downloading-your-two-factor-authentication-recovery-codes/))

## That's it!

If everything worked, your `git push` should work. Further reading below:
